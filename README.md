Chefs:

What we have already:
- Chef model and validations
- chefs table with columns chefname and email

What we need to do:
- Add password to the chefs table so chefs can be authenticated and logged in
- Use email as log in credentials, since email is unique
- Ability to register new chef
- Ability to display chef's profile
- Ability to list chefs using the app
- Ability for chefs to log in and log out of the app
- Restrict actions like create recipe, edit recipe and like feature to logged in chefs only
- Restrict edit of recipes by chefs who created the recipes
